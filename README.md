# Dominance in Goals
Gretzky still holds the nearly untouchable record of goals scored at **894**, with _far less_ games played compared to almost everyone close to him.

| Player        | Games Played  |Goals      |
| ------------  | ------------- |:----------|
| Wayne Gretzky | 1487          | 894       |
| Gordie Howe   | 1767          | 801       |
| Jaromir Jagr  | 1733          | 766       |

## But we may see this finally get broken
Alexander Ovechkin is *currently* on pace to beat this record within the next few seasons pending health.

| Player             | Games Played  |Goals      |
| ------------       | ------------- |:----------|
| Alexander Ovechkin | 1213          | 742       |
